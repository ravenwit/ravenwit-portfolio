A system of two classical point charges governed by the Maxwell's Theory of Electrodynamics and the Lorentz force is considered with relativistic rigor. The solution of the equation of motion for those charged particles are obtained numerically by using the Runge-Kutta Method. The results show a variance with the usual concept of classical electrodynamics. The reason of the abnormalities and the necessary consideration for the allowable solution of the system are reviewed for further analysis.
