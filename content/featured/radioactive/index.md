In this investigation of whether the process of disposal of throwing into Sun or the process of storing waste in asteroid belt is easier. We calculated the amount of thrust required for a space probe carrying nuclear waste. The delta-v required for direct solar impact and solar impact via Jupiter swing-by is 29.8 km/s and 7.174 km/s respectively. Again the thrust required for the probe to reach asteroid belt is 6.274 km/s. From the calculation of probability of collision we got the frequency of collision is 3.49 x 10^(17) year km^(-2). Comparing these results we concluded that storing nuclear waste in asteroid belt is more safe and easier.
