Time dependent evaluation of probability density of a quantum system with Wigner Monte Carlo method based on the signed particle formulation of quantum mechanics. Translated from (C++) and modified on Prof. Dr. Jean Michel Sellier's [implementation](http://www.nano-archimedes.com/download.php/) of (ballistic) single-body Wigner Monte Carlo.
