Earners of this badge have previously earned the badge "Applied Data Science I: Scientific Computing & Python." Additionally, they have successfully completed 2 mini projects and maintained a cumulative average score of 90% or above. The descriptions and skills needed to complete these projects are listed below.
In mini project 1, earners of this badge worked with nursing home inspection data from the United States, predicting which providers may be fined and for how much. They used the scikit-learn Python package to construct progressively more complicated machine learning models. They had to impute missing values, apply feature engineering, and encode categorical data.
In mini project 2, earners of this badge used natural language processing to train various machine learning models to predict an Amazon review rating based on the text of the review. Further, they used one of the trained models to gain insight on the reviews, identifying words that are highly polar. With these highly polar words identified, one can understand what words highly influence the modelâ€™s prediction.
