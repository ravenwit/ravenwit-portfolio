Writing software has become central to research in many fields of science. This school aims to give early-career scientists an introduction to a variety of topics that help them to write efficient, clean, maintainable and long-lived code that is useful beyond solving an immediate problem. In a mixture of talks and many hands-on sessions, the focus lies on showing best practices and building fundamental skills in creating, extending and collaborating on modular and reusable software.
